    "Road accidents are an everlasting issue of society since the invention of the car. One of the first car crashes in Ohio even occurred between the only two cars in the state in 1895, simply because roads were not adjusted properly to cars yet (Higgins, 2019). Ever since then, car safety has been a major selling point in the automobile industry. Car accidents simply do happen due to human or technical error. The goal therefore was to at least protect individuals involved in those crashes. But what if it would be possible to significantly reduce accidents altogether? While modern cars tend to contain a range of driver assisting tools, some companies on the forefront of it all try to implement autonomous driving, based on the fact, that computers are less prone to errors than humans. Bertoncello and Wee of McKinsey (2018) are suggesting that between 2030 and 2050 the amount of accidents might fall by 90% due to the usage of autonomous vehicles. While people involved in an accident might be highly affected, there is also a financial component tied into accidents. For every person killed in a motor-vehicle accident in the US, 8 people are hospitalized and 100 are treated in the emergency room. In 2012 the overall cost of roadway crashes in the U.S. amounted to \\\\$212 billion. A reduction of 90 percent in accidents might therefore decrease the cost to the U.S. economy by $190 billion yearly (Bertoncello & Wee, 2018).\n",

    "## Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The reduction of motor-vehicle accidents therefore has obvious advantages. In the following paper I will use a database on motor vehicle accidents in the UK and utilize machine learning to predict how likely certain circumstances are to create conditions for an accident. This model could then be implemented as a further tool in driver assistance to issue an audible or visible warning when approaching risky situations, which enables the driver to take precautionary actions and prevent an accident. On the other hand this could be implemented in autonomous vehicles. The risk assessment can serve as an input level to reduced speed and greater distances to surrounding vehicles with rising risk levels."

    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "To train the machine learning model, I will rely on a dataset released by the UK government, which covers road accidents between 1979 and 2015. The dataset contains 68 features and more than 285.000 entries. The dataset can be accessed [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/akshay4/road-accidents-incidence) It is important to note, that these statistics only relate to accidents involving personal injury on public roads that are reported to police. Damage-only accidents with no human casualties or accidents on private roads as well as car parks are therefore not included in the data set. \n",
    "Out of the original 68 features I will firstly get rid of some columns that contain missing values and are not of interst for the model that I will be building. That leaves me with the following 54 attributes listed below.\n"
